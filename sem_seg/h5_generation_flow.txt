Data format
    Folder name (this is the name of the location)
    main txt file (this is all data ponts)
    annotation
        this is the labelled data


COLLECT FLOW
    READ FILES
        get points (x,y,z,r,g,b)
        voxelize the data. Or rather a kind of convolution
            set a block size
            set a stride (pixels to skip per turn)

            for each block, pick a specific number of points
            so now you will have your new array

        if the output of room2blocks has dimension 80x4096x6 it means
            80 total blocks
            4096  points per block
            6 = x,y,z,r,g,b
            


        discard voxels if they are below box has below a threshold of voxels (100)



GENERATION FLOW
    Read file of data
        each line of file has  X,Y,Z,R,G,B,Label
        each file is a separate location
